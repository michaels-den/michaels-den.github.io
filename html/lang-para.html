        <h2> Basics </h2>
          <p> Often times developers brag about characteristics of their langauge of choice.
          Usually this bragging is just a strange way of combining opinion with strengths/weaknesses of
          ways of doing things.</p>
          <p> It might be safe to say that until we've all agreed on one language, we can't (and shouldn't)
          argue that one language is better than another. Some languages might be better certain things,
          but then we should be specific about which things.</p>
          <p> Also, "better" inherently means "better for me" - remember that your way of doing things
          may not be better for others.</p>
          <h3> Style </h3>
            <p> Def: style as the most common methodology employed in a given language. </p>
            <p> Examples: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Functional: </li>
              <li> Object Oriented (OO): </li>
              <li> Imperative: </li>
              <li> Declarative: </li>
              <li> Assembly: </li>
              <li> Query: </li>
              </ul>

          <h3> Typing </h3>
            <p> Def: Being "typed" means defining and/or enforcing data classifications in the language.  </p>
            <p> Examples: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Strongly Typed: </li>
              <li> Weakly Typed: </li>
              <li> Dynamically Typed: </li>
              <li> Statically Typed: </li>
              </ul>
            
          <h3> Dialect </h3>
            <p> Def: Some languages are subsets of others, similar to spoken language.  </p>
            <p> Examples: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Clojure is a dialect of LISP. </li>
              </ul>
            
          <h3> Memory Mgmt </h3>
            <p> Def: how a program manages memory is a commonly discussed topic. </p>
            <p> Examples: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Garbage Collection:  </li>
              </ul>
