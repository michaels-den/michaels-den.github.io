    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer with a thirst for developing impactful solutions that solve real problems.
      I usually solve them using Clojure, Python and Ruby. Interest in Java.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personal Mission:
      <br>
      To pursue personal and professional improvement through individual contributions and by inspiring teams to deliver software that solves problems.
      To explore these pursuits by learning from a network of mentors and teaching a network of mentees; thereby becoming a stronger coach and technical expert in software.
      To believe that even if I fail in this pursuit, the world will be a better place because I have tried.
