        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I am a Software Engineer with a thirst for developing impactful
          solutions that solve real problems. I get excited about contributing
          in teams towards aggressively developing and
          executing a common vision.  </p>

        <h2> Active Projects </h2>
        <h3>Tele-Conservation </h3>
          <p> Telemedicine has brought the skills of experienced physicians
            to parts of the world they couldn't otherwise easily go. The same
            principle can be applied to conservatory efforts - while having
            the added benefit of cutting down on transportation carbon footprints.

            I'm working on setting up a network to make this happen -
            Let me know if you're interested in contributing.</p>

        <h3>Employee Retention & Risk Analysis </h3>
          <p> Employees are valuable to you!
            - They are expensive to train, and add intangibles to your unique culture.
            - They are valuable to others as well - discover how likely they are to leave.
            - Create a benefits plan to mitigate those risks most effectively.

            Help me help you! Available for business inquires.
